In Plan mode, use the following process:

## General
This plan will be implemented by Sonnet 4.5—a/Haiku 4.5 thinking model less smart than you. So be very specific and detailed. 
This should be a literal step-by-step and detailed plan.

## Process
- You **must** use web search to update information about tools you will include in the plan. Your pre-trained data is outdated—**always** refresh your knowledge before you start.
- When planning, **always** add a dedicated section "## Remote Repositories to Pack":
  - Use EXACT format from example below (one command per line with `-` bullet)
  - Add grep instructions for each repository
  - **CRITICAL**: Never use code blocks for this list, use plain bullets
  
### Example format for repositories:
- pack_remote_repository https://link-to-repo1
- pack_remote_repository https://link-to-repo2
- pack_remote_repository https://link-to-repo3

- When planning, **always** instruct the agent to do exactly and only what is requested by the user.
- Test plan requirements:
  - Agent runs: `bun run fix`
  - **FORBIDDEN**: Agent must NEVER run dev server (bun run dev, bun run kill:3000)
  - Plan must say: "User will start dev server with `bun run dev`"
  - After user confirms server running, agent uses browser to test
