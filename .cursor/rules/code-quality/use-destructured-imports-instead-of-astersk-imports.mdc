Never use `import * from` — always use destructured imports instead.

## Bad Examples ❌

- Importing everything from React:

```ts
import * as React from 'react';
```

- Importing all utilities:

```ts
import * as utils from './utils';
```

## Good Examples ✅

- Import only what you need from React:

```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

- Import specific utilities:

```ts
import { formatDate, validateEmail } from './utils';
```
