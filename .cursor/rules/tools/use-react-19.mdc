Remember that you are using React 19. Be aware of the key differences from previous versions:

## Key Differences & Examples

### Actions
Asynchronous functions can now be passed directly to `startTransition` to handle form submissions, pending states, error handling, and optimistic updates automatically.

```tsx
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
startTransition(async () => {
  const error = await updateName(name);
  if (error) setError(error);
});
```

### New Hooks
- `useActionState`: Simplifies form handling with async actions.
- `useOptimistic`: Updates UI optimistically while requests complete in the background.
- `use()`: Reads resources (promises or Context) directly in render.

### Ref as a prop
Refs can now be used directly as props, eliminating the need for `forwardRef`.

```tsx
function MyInput({ ref }) {
  return <input ref={ref} />;
}
```

### React Compiler
Automatically optimizes components with memoization, smart re-rendering, and bundle size improvements without manual optimization.

### Breaking Changes
- **New JSX Transform Required**: The modern JSX transform must be enabled.
- Deprecation of old APIs (React 18.3 includes warnings for deprecated features).
