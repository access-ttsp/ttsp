Always use `bun` for package management and `bunx` for executing packages, instead of `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

## Bad Examples ❌

- Installing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
yarn add express
pnpm install
```

- Running scripts:

```bash
npm run dev
npx shadcn-ui add button
```

## Good Examples ✅

- Installing dependencies:

```bash
bun install
bun add express
```

- Running scripts:

```bash
bun run dev
bunx shadcn-ui add button
```

## Why?

- **Performance**: Bun is significantly faster for package installation and script execution.
- **Simplicity**: A unified tool for both package management and script execution.
- **Ecosystem**: Aligns with the project's Bun-first philosophy.
